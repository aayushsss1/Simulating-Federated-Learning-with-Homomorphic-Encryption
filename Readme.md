# Simulating Federated Learning with Homomorphic Encryption

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for simulating Federated Learning with Homomorphic Encryption using a Streamlit app and Flask. This project demonstrates how to train machine learning models across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy through homomorphic encryption. The Streamlit app serves as the user interface for managing and monitoring the federated learning process
